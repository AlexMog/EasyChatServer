EasyChatServer is a project of a WebSocket based chat server.
It uses the SimpleChat protocol (who have been created for this chat): http://labs-epimars.eu/alexmog/projets/melichat/protocole.html

The EasyChatServer is a project started mainly for Melinyel, a french community of developpers and computers fans.
This project is a really cool project, and it was fun to develop it.

Now the project is OpenSource, and if you wish to give us ideas (to add things to the protocol or to the server) you can contact me at this adress: alexandre.moghrabi@epitech.eu

I- Installation
This server uses the LibWebSock that can be find there: https://github.com/payden/libwebsock/
Requirements: LibWebSock, Libevent
You can find how to install the lib there: https://github.com/payden/libwebsock/wiki/Installation

To install the server, you have to make it first, type this in your console:
make re
this will make the server, if there is no errors, the server will be found in the directory "bin".

II- How to use
To use the server, you have first to configure it.
You can find the configuration file in the bin directory (filename: configs.cfg).
Everything is explained in the config file.
After configuring the server, simply launch ./server .

III- Thanks and credits
I want to thanks Anaeria (http://www.evade-multimedia.net/) for her cool work on a web-based graphic client.
I want also to thanks the Melinyel community (http://melinyel.net) whithout whom the project would not have existed.

For the credits, you can share this code, and modify it if you want, but please, leave a little copyright for ouer work.

Have fun with this project!

AlexMog.
